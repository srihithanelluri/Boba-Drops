  About Me!
  <script src="script.js"></script>
  <p>My name is Srihitha. I like to read, hang out with friends, draw, and listen to music. Reading is one of my favorite pass times and I just love getting engulfed into a new world every time I open another book. Art is also something I am very passionate about. I have been doing it for years and it is something that I find really relaxing because it just takes my mind off of any other things going on in my life. I am 13 years old and go to Hopkins Middle School. I play basketball and love to swim. I also love coding and want to learn more about it. I have been learning how to code using python for a couple of years and am so excited to learn more coding languages, for example, html, which I used to create this website. </p>
